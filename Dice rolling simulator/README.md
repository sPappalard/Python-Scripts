# Dice Roller Game

This script allows users to roll a specified number of dice and displays the results in a fun ASCII format. You can choose how many dice to roll, and the script will generate random results for each die. It also includes an animation for the rolling process, which varies based on the number of dice.

## Features

1. **Rolling Dice:**
   - The user can specify how many dice to roll (any positive integer).
   - The script generates random results (between 1 and 6) for each die.

2. **ASCII Dice Faces:**
   - The results of the dice rolls are displayed in an easy-to-read ASCII art format.

3. **Rolling Animation:**
   - A simple animation is shown before the dice results are displayed:
     - For fewer than 5 dice, the animation runs 3 times.
     - For 5 to 19 dice, the animation runs 6 times.
     - For 20 or more dice, the animation runs 10 times.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to roll the dice, and they can choose to roll again or exit the game.
   - If the user enters an invalid input, they are prompted again to provide a valid response.

5. **Exit Option:**
   - After each roll, the user can choose to roll again or exit the game. If they choose to exit, the script will thank them and terminate.

## How to Play

3. The dice results will be displayed in a neat ASCII format, showing the faces of the dice.
4. After viewing the results, you can choose to roll again or exit the game.
